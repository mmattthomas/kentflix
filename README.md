# Kentflix

Kentflix is a little hobby app to rekindle my affection for Rails.  Its been a while so we'll see how it goes.
The intent is a simple application to log into where you can view a list of movies and check-in/check-out

Product Roadmap:

- [x] Bootstrap CSS
- [x] User Authentication (Devise)
- [x] Movie object list, forms
- [X] Show who is checked out to (or "Available")
- [X] Check-out/Check-in Button
- --- sort of functional
- [X] Fix movie list to show who has what movie
- [ ] Show how many movies you have checked out, and limit/warn going over
- [ ] Role enforcement [cancancan]
- [ ] Improve rating display as stars
- [ ] Improve Admin/Edit forms (dates, foreign key check-out)
- [ ] 1.0 ! RELEASE TO HEROKU
- [ ] Subscribe to be notified when something's available (need sendgrid or smtp)
- [ ] User comments/ratings
