# Kentflix

Kentflix is a little hobby app to rekindle my affection for Rails.  Its been a while so we'll see how it goes.
The intent is a simple application to log into where you can view a list of movies and check-in/check-out

Product Roadmap:

- [x] Bootstrap CSS
- [x] User Authentication (Devise)
- [x] Movie object list, forms
- [ ] Show who is checked out to (or "Available")
- [ ] Check-out/Check-in Button
- [ ] Role enforcement [cancancan]
- [ ] Improve rating display as stars
- [ ] Improve Admin/Edit forms (dates, foreign key check-out)
- [ ] 1.0 !
- [ ] Subscribe to be notified when something's available (need sendgrid or smtp)
- [ ] User comments/ratings
- [ ] User rating amalgamation/average 
- [ ] External data: Rotten Tomatoes score, image, imdb, etc.
